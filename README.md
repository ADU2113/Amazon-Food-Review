## 2Ã—2 Matrix TDM - Amazon Food Reviews  

This repository contains an analysis of *Amazon Fine Food Reviews* using a *2Ã—2 Term-Document Matrix (TDM)* for sentiment classification. The goal is to predict sentiment labels and evaluate model performance using *precision, recall, and F1-score* metrics.

## ðŸ“Œ Dataset Overview  

The dataset used in this project is *Amazon Fine Food Reviews, available on **Kaggle*:  
ðŸ“Œ [Amazon Fine Food Reviews Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/snap/amazon-fine-food-reviews)  

- *1,568,454* reviews from *Amazon*  
- Includes product reviews, ratings, and sentiment labels  
- Focuses on food-related items  

For this analysis, we use a *subset* of the dataset to classify sentiment into:  
- *1 â†’ Negative Review*  
- *2 â†’ Positive Review*  

The model is trained on *142,114 reviews*, and performance is evaluated based on classification metrics.
